## Log-normal distribution
100 values, mu=1, sigma=.25
```{r cars}
x <- rlnorm(100,1,0.25)
```

## Histogram of the distribution

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(x,main = "Histogram of the distribution", xlab = "Variable", ylab = "Frequency of variables")
```

## Histogram of the distribution on the log scale
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(log(x),main = "Histogram of the distribution on the log scale")
```

##  Mean and variance of the sample
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
mean(x)
var(x)
```
